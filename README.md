# blockchain-rust

Development Status: Inactive

The mvp was achieved, but a later addition is intended to integrate this with matttm/vote-chain

## Description

This is a small program written in Rust using libp2p to create a decentralized blockchain. Each node will use the multicast DNS (mDNS) protocol to automatically discover other nodes on the local network and the noise protocol to provide encryption. Floodsub is the main protocol being used for communication of the blockchain data itself.
